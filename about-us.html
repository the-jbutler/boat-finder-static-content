							<p class="lead">Because most people find out what kind of boat they really wanted AFTER they have bought their first boat. For example, boat salesman love to show you the lovely wide beds, and spacious hulls - they don't tell you that the extra weight makes the boat as slow as a pig.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-12 col-lg-6">
							<p class="lead">They love to show you videos of the boat doing 20 knots - they don’t tell you that it will never do that once you have loaded up with fuel, water and groceries. They love to show you the enormous fridge full of beer - they don’t tell you that it will chew power you don't have.</p>

										You tell us about you

									<li class="mb-3">
										Then we eliminate all the boats that are NOT right for you. Like that sleek French racer that can do 20 knots on a sneeze&hellip;until you load it with a few people, bottles of wine and groceries, when it wallows like a hippo
									</li>
									<li class="mb-3">
										Then we show you how to fit the boats you want to your budget. Armchair sailors will tell you sternly that you can have any two, but never all three, of price, performance and comfort. That is just not true. It is true that very few of us can afford a brand new version of the boat we want. The art lies in making compromises on the things that don’t matter (like buying a three year old boat rather than a brand new one) rather than the things that do matter. Like buying a boat we will never love, just because it’s affordable

					<h2 class="my-4">Who are we?</h2>
					<p>Every good team needs some experts and some idiots.</p>
					<p>The experts are Tom from Synergy Yachting, a pair of geeku obsessives, who spent 15 years as charter captains in the BVI, have sailed just about every boat out there, dissected its performance over too many rum punches. They know everything there is to know about yachts.</p>
					<p>The idiot is me, recently retired as CEO of a public company in the UK, just bought my first ever yacht and spent 6 months sailing it in the Caribbean. My role is to ask the stupid questions so that you don’t have to.</p>
					<p>I found Tom when I was looking for my first boat and his advice was so useful, I connected his brain to my computer, downloaded the contents and have made it available to you. If you want to get some advice directly, please do go direct to Tomby emailing him at <a href="mailto:Tom@synergyyachting.com" title="Send an email to Tom@synergyyachting.com">Tom@synergyyachting.com</a>.</p>
